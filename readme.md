ios-webapps

With no desire to sign up for an Apple Developer account, and with enough HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge under my belt, I've made a few webapps to find interesting solutions to problems.

The .htaccess featured in this folder is necessary to make Apache serve up .manifest files properly to enable HTML5 offline caching.  This should either be placed higher in one's folder hierarchy than individual webapps, or copied into each such app's folder/directory.
